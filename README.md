# Bloodborne Chalice Guide

GUI chalice guide for the game Bloodborne. 

The game implements a "chalice" mechanic, in which players can descend into various levels, fight monsters, and find loot and items, but because they're so vast and/or labyrinthine it's handy to know where things are ahead of time. This is meant to give players that knowledge.

## Using It

The guide requires Python and Pip to be installed and runs on the Flask micro-framework. It's very much still under development.

## Data

The info is compiled from submissions found [here] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18TVy5cDk6sNX0lc2dNQM2Q-SLv0_9QecQrtKR0sRb6Q/edit#gid=1095946635#button-dungeon).
