# Bloodborne Chalice Guide

GUI chalice guide for the game Bloodborne. 

The game implements a "chalice" mechanic, in which players can descend into various levels, fight monsters, and find loot and items, but because they're so vast and/or labyrinthine it's handy to know where things are ahead of time. This is meant to give players that knowledge.

## Using It

The guide requires Python and Pip to be installed.

If you really want to try it out, you can proceed with the following after cloning:

    source venv/bin/activate
    cd Bloodborne_Chalice_Guide
    pip install -r requirements.txt

That should get you up and running. You can then start the server up with:

    pserve development.ini
