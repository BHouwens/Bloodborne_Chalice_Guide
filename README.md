# Bloodborne Chalice Guide

GUI chalice guide for the game Bloodborne. 

The game implements a "chalice" mechanic, in which players can descend into various levels, fight monsters, and find loot and items, but because they're so vast and/or labyrinthine it's handy to know where things are ahead of time. This is meant to give players that knowledge.

## Using It

The guide requires Python and Pip to be installed and runs on the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework. It's very much still under development.

If you would like to take a quick look, you can run the following from the project root:

    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python app.py
    
And then follow the terminal prompts.
